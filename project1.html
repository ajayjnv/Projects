                        <h3>Chicken Dum Biryani Procedure</h3><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 1: Marination</strong></p>
                        <p>In a large bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder,
                            turmeric powder, garam masala, coriander powder, salt, lemon juice, fried onions, and slit
                            green chilies. Cover the bowl and marinate the chicken for at least 2 hours (overnight for
                            best results).</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 2: Preparing the Rice</strong></p>
                        <p>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes. In a large pot, boil
                            water and add whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon stick) and salt. Add the
                            soaked rice and cook until it is 70% cooked (parboiled). Drain the rice and set it aside.
                        </p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 3: Layering the Biryani</strong></p>
                        <p>In a heavy-bottomed pot, spread a layer of marinated chicken at the bottom. Spread a layer of
                            parboiled rice over the chicken. Sprinkle fried onions, chopped mint leaves, coriander
                            leaves, and a few drops of saffron milk over the rice layer. Repeat the layers if needed,
                            ending with a rice layer on top. Drizzle ghee over the top layer for added flavor.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 4: Dum Cooking</strong></p>
                        <p>Seal the pot tightly with a lid. You can use dough to ensure a proper seal. Place the pot on
                            low heat and cook for 25-30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend (dum cooking).
                            Alternatively, you can place the sealed pot on a heated griddle (tava) for indirect heat and
                            cook for the same duration.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 5: Serving</strong></p>
                        <p>Carefully open the lid and mix the biryani gently to avoid breaking the rice grains. Serve
                            hot with raita, salad, or your favorite side dish.</p><br>

                        <h3>Puri and Potato Curry Procedure : </h3><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 1: Preparing the Puri Dough</strong></p>
                        <p>In a large bowl, mix the whole wheat flour and salt. Add a tablespoon of oil or ghee and rub
                            it into the flour. Gradually add water to form a stiff dough. Knead the dough until smooth
                            and elastic, then cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rest for about 20 minutes.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 2: Rolling the Puris</strong></p>
                        <p>After resting, divide the dough into small equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a small
                            circle (about 3-4 inches in diameter) using a rolling pin. Make sure the puris are evenly
                            rolled and not too thick.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 3: Frying the Puris</strong></p>
                        <p>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, gently slide in the
                            rolled puris, one at a time. Fry them until they puff up and turn golden brown on both
                            sides. Remove them from the oil and drain excess oil on a paper towel. Continue frying the
                            remaining puris.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 4: Preparing the Potato Curry</strong></p>
                        <p>Heat oil in a pan, and add mustard seeds. When they splutter, add curry leaves (if using) and
                            green chilies. Add chopped onions and sauté them until they become golden brown. Then add
                            ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute. Stir in chopped tomatoes and cook until
                            they soften.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 5: Cooking the Curry</strong></p>
                        <p>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt to the tomatoes. Stir the
                            mixture well and let it cook for a minute. Add the boiled and diced potatoes and mix gently.
                            You can mash some of the potatoes to thicken the curry. Pour in water to adjust the
                            consistency, and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes. Finally, add garam masala and garnish with
                            fresh coriander leaves.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 6: Serving</strong></p>
                        <p>Serve the hot puris with the potato curry. Enjoy this delicious Indian meal with yogurt or
                            pickle, if desired!</p><br>

                        <h3>South Indian Dosa Procedure : </h3><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 1: Preparing the Batter</strong></p>
                        <p>Wash the rice and urad dal thoroughly in water. Soak the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds
                            separately for 4-6 hours. If using poha, soak it for 30 minutes before grinding. After
                            soaking, drain the water and grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds into a smooth paste,
                            adding water as needed. Grind the rice and poha (if used) into a slightly coarse paste.
                            Combine the two pastes in a large bowl and mix well. Cover the bowl and allow the batter to
                            ferment overnight or for 8-12 hours in a warm place.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 2: Preparing the Batter for Cooking</strong></p>
                        <p>After fermentation, the batter should have risen and turned slightly frothy. Add salt to the
                            batter and mix gently. Adjust the consistency with water to make it pourable but not too
                            runny.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 3: Cooking the Dosas</strong></p>
                        <p>Heat a flat, non-stick pan or a cast-iron griddle over medium heat. Once hot, lightly grease
                            the pan with oil or ghee using a paper towel or a piece of onion. Pour a ladleful of batter
                            in the center of the pan and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin layer. Drizzle a
                            few drops of oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the edges
                            start lifting and the dosa turns golden brown. Flip the dosa if you prefer cooking the other
                            side; otherwise, serve it directly from the pan.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 4: Serving</strong></p>
                        <p>Serve the hot dosas with coconut chutney, sambar, or any preferred side dish. Enjoy this
                            classic South Indian delicacy!</p><br>

                        <h3>Tamarind Rice Procedure : </h3><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 1: Preparing the Tamarind Paste</strong></p>
                        <p>Soak a small piece of tamarind in warm water for about 10-15 minutes. After soaking, mash the
                            tamarind and
                            extract the juice by filtering out the seeds and fiber. Set the tamarind extract aside.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p><strong>Step 2: Preparing the Rice</strong></p>
                        <p>Cook the rice separately in a pressure cooker or on the stove until soft and fully cooked.
                            Once cooked,
                            spread the rice on a plate to let it cool slightly and avoid clumping.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 3: Tempering the Spices</strong></p>
                        <p>Heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds. Once they splutter, add cumin seeds, dry red
                            chilies, and curry
                            leaves. Sauté for a few seconds, then add a pinch of asafoetida (hing) for flavor.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 4: Adding the Tamarind Paste</strong></p>
                        <p>Next, add the tamarind extract to the pan along with jaggery (if used), salt, and turmeric
                            powder. Stir the
                            mixture and cook it for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to combine and the tamarind paste
                            to thicken
                            slightly.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 5: Mixing the Rice</strong></p>
                        <p>Add the cooled rice to the tamarind mixture and mix well, ensuring the rice is evenly coated
                            with the
                            tamarind sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally to combine the
                            flavors.</p><br>

                        <p><strong>Step 6: Garnishing and Serving</strong></p>
                        <p>Garnish the tamarind rice with roasted peanuts, cashews, and fresh coriander leaves. Serve
                            the tamarind rice
                            hot, accompanied by papad, raita, or any side dish of your choice!</p><br>
